# IDFK_Discord_Bots
All the bots running on the IDFK discord server that ive made  
---
These bots are very basic and just me messing about.  

## GPT bot  
This bot gets every message from the server and replies to it, adding the conversation to the memory, configure how long you want the memory by changing the `MAX_CONVERSATION_LENGTH` to something else. Conversation does not include the system message, it will not be deleted.  

## n-word bot  
Just counts how many times the n-word is said, good for toxic servers i guess. (had to remove the actual words, just add them back)  

## AI image bot  
Uses DALL-E 2 image api to generate images when someone says !generateimage prompt (changable)
